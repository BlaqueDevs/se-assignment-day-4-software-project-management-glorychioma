## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are two distinct software development methodologies with different approaches to project execution. Agile is an iterative and incremental approach where development occurs in cycles or sprints, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptability to changing requirements. In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process, where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.

One key difference is flexibility. Agile is highly adaptable, making it suitable for projects with evolving requirements, whereas Waterfall is rigid and best suited for projects with well-defined, stable requirements. Agile promotes continuous testing and customer involvement throughout the development process, while Waterfall relies on extensive planning and formal documentation, with testing occurring only after development is completed.

Agile's main advantages include faster delivery, improved customer satisfaction through regular feedback, and early detection of issues. However, it requires close collaboration, can be difficult to estimate costs and timelines, and may lack thorough documentation. On the other hand, Waterfall ensures a structured approach with clear documentation and is easier to manage when project requirements are fixed. Its disadvantages include inflexibility to changes, late detection of issues due to delayed testing, and longer development cycles before product delivery.

Overall, Agile is best for dynamic and complex projects requiring flexibility, while Waterfall works well for projects with strict regulations and well-defined requirements. The choice depends on project needs, stakeholder involvement, and the level of predictability required.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for projects that require flexibility, frequent feedback, and iterative development. It is ideal for complex, evolving projects where requirements are uncertain or likely to change. Examples include:  

- Software Startups – A tech startup developing a new mobile app, where user feedback continuously shapes the product.  
- Web Development – An e-commerce platform that needs frequent updates based on user behavior and market trends.  
- Game Development – A video game studio incorporating new features and improvements based on beta testing feedback.  

On the other hand, Waterfall is better suited for projects with well-defined requirements, strict regulations, and minimal expected changes. It works best when all phases must be carefully planned and executed sequentially. Examples include:  

- Government Projects – A public sector IT system where strict documentation and approvals are required.  
- Construction & Engineering – Building a bridge or an airport, where structural planning and compliance are critical.  
- Banking & Finance Software – Developing a financial transaction system where security and regulatory requirements must be met from the start.  

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
### **Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in a Software Project**  

1. Automated & Manual Testing – Use automated testing for efficiency and manual testing for in-depth analysis.  
2. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Regularly merge code and deploy updates to detect issues early.  
3. Code Reviews & Peer Reviews – Ensure code quality through collaborative evaluation before merging changes.  
4. Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Write tests before writing the actual code to ensure functionality meets requirements.  
5. Bug Tracking & Issue Management – Use tools like Jira or Bugzilla to document and resolve defects efficiently.  
6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validate the software with real users to ensure it meets business needs.  
7. Performance & Security Testing – Assess system speed, stability, and vulnerability to threats.  

Importance of Maintaining High Standards  
Ensuring high-quality software prevents bugs, reduces rework costs, and enhances user satisfaction. Poor quality can lead to system failures, security breaches, and a damaged reputation. High standards also improve maintainability, scalability, and compliance with industry regulations, ensuring long-term success.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope makes the project focused, organised and easy to carryout completely.
Work breakdown structure:
